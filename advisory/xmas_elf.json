      "description": "Affected versions of this crate only validated the `index` argument of\n`HashTable::get_bucket` and `HashTable::get_chain` against the input-controlled\n`bucket_count` and `chain_count` fields, but not against the size of the ELF\nsection. As a result, a malformed ELF file could trigger out-of-bounds reads in\na consumer of the HashTable API by setting these fields to inappropriately large\nvalues that would fall outside the relevant hash table section, and by\nintroducing correspondingly out-of-bounds hash table indexes elsewhere in the ELF\nfile.",
