The new repository location is at:\n\n<https://github.com/RustCrypto/block-ciphers/tree/master/aes>\n\nThe `aes` crate now has an optional `ctr` feature which autodetects SIMD\nfeatures on `i686`/`x86-64` targets and uses them if available, or otherwise\nfalls back to the implementation in the `ctr` crate.\n\nIf you would prefer not to have this autodetection performed, use the `aes`\ncrate directly with the `ctr` crate.",
