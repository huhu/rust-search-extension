      "description": "In the affected versions of the crate, `AtomicBucket<T>` unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` traits. Therefore, users can create a data race to the inner\n`T: !Sync` by using the `AtomicBucket::data_with()` API.\nSuch data races can potentially cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was fixed in commit 8e6daab by adding appropriate Send/Sync bounds to the Send/Sync impl of struct `Block<T>` (which is a data type contained inside `AtomicBucket<T>`).",
