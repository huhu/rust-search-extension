The new repository location is at:\n\n<https://github.com/RustCrypto/block-ciphers/tree/master/aes>\n\nAES-NI is now autodetected at runtime on `i686`/`x86-64` platforms.\nIf AES-NI is not present, the `aes` crate will fallback to a constant-time\nportable software implementation.\n\nTo force the use of a constant-time portable implementation on these platforms,\neven if AES-NI is available, use the new `force-soft` feature of the `aes`\ncrate to disable autodetection.",
