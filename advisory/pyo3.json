      "description": "`PyString::from_object` took `&str` arguments and forwarded them directly to the Python C API without checking for terminating nul bytes. This could lead the Python interpreter to read beyond the end of the `&str` data and potentially leak contents of the out-of-bounds read (by raising a Python exception containing a copy of the data including the overflow).\n\nIn PyO3 0.24.1 this function will now allocate a `CString` to guarantee a terminating nul bytes. PyO3 0.25 will likely offer an alternative API which takes `&CStr` arguments.",

In combination with workflows using tools such as `maturin` to build for multiple versions in a single build, this leads to Python wheels being compiled against the wrong Python API version.\n\nAll users who distribute artefacts for multiple Python versions are encouraged to update and rebuild with PyO3 0.23.3. Affected wheels produced from PyO3 0.23.0 through 0.23.2 are highly unstable and will crash the Python interpreter in unpredictable ways.",
