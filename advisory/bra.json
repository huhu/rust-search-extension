      "description": "Affected versions of this crate creates an uninitialized buffer and passes it to user-provided `Read` implementation.\n\nThis is unsound, because it allows safe Rust code to exhibit an undefined behavior (read from uninitialized memory).\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 0.1.1 by zero-initializing a newly allocated buffer\nbefore handing it to a user-provided `Read` implementation.",
