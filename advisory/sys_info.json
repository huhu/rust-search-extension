      "description": "Affected versions of `sys-info` use a static, global, list to store temporary disk information while running. The function that cleans up this list,\n`DFCleanup`, assumes a single threaded environment and will try to free the same memory twice in a multithreaded environment.\n\nThis results in consistent double-frees and segfaults when calling `sys_info::disk_info` from multiple threads at once.\n\nThe issue was fixed by moving the global variable into a local scope.\n\n## Safer Alternatives:\n - [`sysinfo`](https://crates.io/crates/sysinfo)",
