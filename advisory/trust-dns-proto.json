      "description": "There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses a\nmalicious DNS packet.\n\nAffected versions of this crate did not properly handle parsing of DNS message\ncompression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be tricked into infinite\nloop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain name to be\nparsed.\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which when consumed\nwith Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by trust-dns-proto 0.4.3 and upcoming 0.5.0 release.",
