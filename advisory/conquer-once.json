      "description": "Affected versions of `conquer-once` implements `Sync` for its `OnceCell` type\nwithout restricting it to `Send`able types.\n\nThis allows non-`Send` but `Sync` types such as `MutexGuard` to be sent across\nthreads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent\nprograms.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding a `Send` constraint to `OnceCell`.",
