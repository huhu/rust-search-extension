This requires an environment variable to be set in a different thread than the affected functions. This may occur without the user's knowledge, notably in a third-party library.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds are known.\n\n### References\n\n- [time-rs/time#293](https://github.com/time-rs/time/issues/293)",
