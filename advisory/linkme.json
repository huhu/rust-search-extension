      "description": "Affected versions allow populating a DistributedSlice of T with elements of an\narbitrary other type that coerces to T. For example, elements of type `&&str`\ncould end up in a slice of type `[&str]`, since `&&str` coerces to `&str` via a\nderef coercion.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by implementing typechecking for distributed slice\nelements in such a way that coercion no longer occurs. The element's type must\nbe a subtype of the slice's declared element type.",
