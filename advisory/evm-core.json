      "description": "Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related\nto memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the\ncrate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it\npossible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`.",
