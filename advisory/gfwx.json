      "description": "In the affected versions of this crate, `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>` unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync`, allowing to create data races.\n\nThis can result in a memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5 by adding `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl and adding `T: Sync` bound to the `Sync` impl.",
