The new repository location is at:\n\n<https://github.com/RustCrypto/block-ciphers/tree/master/aes>\n\nAES-NI is now autodetected at runtime on `i686`/`x86-64` platforms.\nIf AES-NI is not present, the `aes` crate will fallback to a constant-time\nportable software implementation.\n\nTo prevent this fallback (and have absence of AES-NI result in an illegal\ninstruction crash instead), continue to pass the same RUSTFLAGS which were\npreviously required for the `aesni` crate to compile:\n\n```\nRUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes,+ssse3\n```",
