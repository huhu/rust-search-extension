      "description": "The library provides a public safe API `transmute_vec_as_bytes`, which incorrectly assumes that any generic type `T` could have stable layout, causing to uninitialized memory exposure if the users pass any types with padding bytes as `T` and cast it to `u8` pointer.  \n\nIn the [issue](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/630), we develop a PoC to show passing struct type to `transmute_vec_as_bytes` could lead to undefined behavior with `Vec::from_raw_parts`.  \n\nThe developers provide a patch by changing trait of `Copy` to `Pod`, which can make sure `T` should be plain data. This was patched in the latest version of [master](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/blob/3f9ad6f9667047dac051b0e97d544e5b38e5ae72/fyrox-core/src/lib.rs#L351-L360) branch, but still not on the latest release (0.28.1).",
