      "description": "Affected versions of this crate tried to preallocate a vector for an arbitrary amount of bytes announced by the ASN.1-DER length field without further checks.\n\nThis allows an attacker to trigger a SIGABRT by creating length fields that announce more bytes than the allocator can provide.\n \nThe flaw was corrected by not preallocating memory.",
