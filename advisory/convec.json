      "description": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `ConVec<T>`.\nThis allows users to insert `T` that is not Send or not Sync.\n\nThis allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<_>>` or `Rc<_>` as `T` in `ConVec<T>`. It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell<_>` or `RefCell<_>` as `T` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption.",
