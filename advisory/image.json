      "description": "A mutable reference to a struct was constructed by dereferencing a pointer\nobtained from `slice::as_ptr`. Instead, `slice::as_mut_ptr` should have been\ncalled on the mutable slice argument. The former performs an implicit reborrow\nas an immutable shared reference which does not allow writing through the\nderived pointer.\n\nThere is no evidence for miscompilation, exploitable or otherwise, caused by\nthis bug. [Further investigation on Zulip][Zulip] suggests that the unoptimized\ngenerated LLVM IR does not contain any UB itself, effectively mitigating\nfurther effects.\n\n[Zulip]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/146229-wg-secure-code/topic/Implications.20of.20using.20.60slice.3A.3Aas_ptr.60.20for.20mutable.20access/near/216499472",

They would then also call other code that could panic before\ninitializing all instances.\n\nThis could run Drop implementations on uninitialized types, equivalent to\nuse-after-free, and allow an attacker arbitrary code execution.\n\nTwo different fixes were applied. It is possible to conserve the interface by\nensuring proper initialization before calling `Vec::set_len`. Drop is no longer\ncalled in case of panic, though.\n\nStarting from version `0.22`, a breaking change to the interface requires\ncallers to pre-allocate the output buffer and pass a mutable slice instead,\navoiding all unsafe code.",
