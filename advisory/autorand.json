      "description": "Affected versions of this crate had a panic safety issue to drop partially uninitialized array of `T` upon panic in a user provided function `T::random()`. Dropping uninitialized `T` can potentially cause memory corruption or undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 565d508 by using `MaybeUninit<T>` to avoid possible dropping of uninitialized memory upon panic.",
