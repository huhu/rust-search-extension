      "description": "The following functions in the crate are affected:\n\n## `IdMap::clone_from`\n\nThe `clone_from` implementation for `IdMap` drops the values present in the\nmap and then begins cloning values from the other map. If a `.clone()` call\npancics, then the afformentioned dropped elements can be freed again.\n\n## `get_or_insert`\n\n`get_or_insert` reserves space for a value, before calling the user provided\ninsertion function `f`. If the function `f` panics then uninitialized or\npreviously freed memory can be dropped.\n\n## `remove_set`\n\nWhen removing a set of elements, `ptr::drop_in_place` is called on each of the\nelement to be removed. If the `Drop` impl of one of these elements panics then\nthe previously dropped elements can be dropped again.",
