      "description": "The library breaks the safety assumptions when using unsafe API `slice::from_raw_parts_mut`. The pointer passed to `from_raw_parts_mut` is misaligned by casting `u8` to `u16` raw pointer directly, which is unsound. The bug is patched by using `align_offset`, which could make sure the memory address is aligned to 2 bytes for `u16`.  \n\nThis was patched in 0.11.2 in the [commit](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL/pull/1530/commits/5a60cb31ef587d71d09d534bba39bd3973c4b35d).",
