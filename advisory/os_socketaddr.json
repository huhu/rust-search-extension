It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the\nsystem representation.\n\nThese layout were [changed into idiomatic rust types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78802)\nin nightly `std`. Starting from rustc 1.64 the affected versions of this crate will have undefined\nbehaviour.",
