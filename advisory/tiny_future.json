      "description": "`tiny_future` contains a light-weight implementation of `Future`s. The `Future`\ntype it has lacked bound on its `Send` and `Sync` traits.\n\nThis allows for a bug where non-thread safe types such as `Cell` can be used in\n`Future`s and cause data races in concurrent programs.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `c791919` by adding trait bounds to `Future`'s\n`Send` and `Sync`.",
