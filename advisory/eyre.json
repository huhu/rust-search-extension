      "title": "Parts of Report are dropped as the wrong type during downcast",
      "description": "In affected versions, after a `Report` is constructed using `wrap_err` or\n`wrap_err_with` to attach a message of type `D` onto an error of type `E`, then\nusing `downcast` to recover ownership of either the value of type `D` or the\nvalue of type `E`, one of two things can go wrong:\n\n- If downcasting to `E`, there remains a value of type `D` to be dropped. It is\n  incorrectly \"dropped\" by running `E`'s drop behavior, rather than `D`'s. For\n  example if `D` is `&str` and `E` is `std::io::Error`, there would be a call of\n  `std::io::Error::drop` in which the reference received by the `Drop` impl does\n  not refer to a valid value of type `std::io::Error`, but instead to `&str`.\n\n- If downcasting to `D`, there remains a value of type `E` to be dropped. When\n  `D` and `E` do not happen to be the same size, `E`'s drop behavior is\n  incorrectly executed in the wrong location. The reference received by the\n  `Drop` impl may point left or right of the real `E` value that is meant to be\n  getting dropped.\n\nIn both cases, when the `Report` contains an error `E` that has nontrivial drop\nbehavior, the most likely outcome is memory corruption.\n\nWhen the `Report` contains an error `E` that has trivial drop behavior (for\nexample a `Utf8Error`) but where `D` has nontrivial drop behavior (such as\n`String`), the most likely outcome is that downcasting to `E` would leak `D`.",
