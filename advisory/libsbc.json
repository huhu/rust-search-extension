      "description": "Affected versions of this crate implements `Send` for `Decoder<R>` for any `R: Read`. This allows `Decoder<R>` to contain `R: !Send` and carry (move) it to another thread.\n\nThis can result in undefined behavior such as memory corruption from data race on `R`, or dropping `R = MutexGuard<_>` from a thread that didn't lock the mutex.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit a34d6e1 by adding trait bound `R: Send` to the `Send` impl for `Decoder<R>`.",
