      "description": "Affected versions of the `alloy-json-abi` crate did not properly handle parsing of malformatted JSON ABI strings. The `JsonAbi::parse` method can be tricked into a stack overflow when processing specially crafted input. \n\nThis stack overflow can lead to a crash of the application using this crate, potentially causing a denial of service.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit 4790c47.",
