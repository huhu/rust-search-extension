      "title": "Out-of-bounds write in nix::unistd::getgrouplist",
      "description": "On certain platforms, if a user has more than 16 groups, the\n`nix::unistd::getgrouplist` function will call the libc `getgrouplist`\nfunction with a length parameter greater than the size of the buffer it\nprovides, resulting in an out-of-bounds write and memory corruption.\n\nThe libc `getgrouplist` function takes an in/out parameter `ngroups`\nspecifying the size of the group buffer. When the buffer is too small to\nhold all of the requested user's group memberships, some libc\nimplementations, including glibc and Solaris libc, will modify `ngroups`\nto indicate the actual number of groups for the user, in addition to\nreturning an error. The version of `nix::unistd::getgrouplist` in nix\n0.16.0 and up will resize the buffer to twice its size, but will not\nread or modify the `ngroups` variable. Thus, if the user has more than\ntwice as many groups as the initial buffer size of 8, the next call to\n`getgrouplist` will then write past the end of the buffer.\n\nThe issue would require editing /etc/groups to exploit, which is usually\nonly editable by the root user.",
