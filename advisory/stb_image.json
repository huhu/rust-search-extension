      "description": "A bug in error handling in the `stb_image` C library could cause a NULL pointer dereference when attempting to load an invalid or unsupported image file.  This is fixed in version 0.2.5 and later of the `stb_image` Rust crate, by patching the C code to correctly handle NULL pointers.\n\nThank you to GitHub user 0xdd96 for finding and fixing this vulnerability.",
