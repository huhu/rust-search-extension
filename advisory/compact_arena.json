      "description": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly implement the generativity,\nbecause the invariant lifetimes were not necessarily `drop`ped.\n\nThis allows an attacker to mix up two arenas, using indices created from one\narena with another one. This might lead to an out-of-bounds read or write\naccess into the memory reserved for the arena.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by implementing generativity correctly in version 0.4.0.",
