      "description": "Affected versions of `rusb` did not require `UsbContext` to implement `Send`\nand `Sync`. However, through `Device` and `DeviceHandle` it is possible to use\n`UsbContext`s across threads.\n\nThis issue allows non-thread safe `UsbContext` types to be used concurrently\nleading to data races and memory corruption.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding `Send` and `Sync` bounds to `UsbContext`.",
