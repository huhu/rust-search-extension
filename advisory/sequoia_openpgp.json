Notably, this includes all\nsoftware using the `sequoia_cert_store` crate.\n\n## Details\n\nThe `RawCertParser` does not advance the input stream when\nencountering unsupported cert (primary key) versions, resulting in an\ninfinite loop.\n\nThe fix introduces a new raw-cert-specific\n`cert::raw::Error::UnuspportedCert`.\n\n## Affected software\n\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.13.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.14.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.15.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.16.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.17.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.18.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.19.0\n- sequoia-openpgp 1.20.0\n- Any software built against a vulnerable version of sequoia-openpgp\n  which is directly or indirectly using the interface\n  `sequoia_openpgp::cert::raw::RawCertParser`.
