      "description": "Uninit memory is used as a RNG seed in temporary\n\nThe following function is used as a way to get entropy from the system, which does operations on and exposes uninit memory, which is UB.\n\n```rust\nfn random_seed(_: &Path, _: &str) -> [u64; 2] {\n    use std::mem::uninitialized as rand;\n    unsafe { [rand::<u64>() ^ 0x12345678, rand::<u64>() ^ 0x87654321] }\n}\n```\n\nThis has been resolved in the 0.6.4 release.\n\nThe crate is not intended to be used outside of a testing environment.\n\nFor a general purpose crate to create temporary directories, [`tempfile`](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile) is an alternative for this crate.",
