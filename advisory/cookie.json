      "description": "Affected versions of this crate use the `time` crate and the method\n`Duration::seconds` to parse the `Max-Age` duration cookie setting. This method\nwill panic if the value is greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to\n2^64, which can result in denial of service for a client or server.\n\nThis flaw was corrected by explicitly checking for the `Max-Age` being in this\ninteger range and clamping the value to the maximum duration value.",
