      "description": "SputnikVM, also called evm, is a Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nA custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if\nthe call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide\nif stateful operations should be done.\n\nPrior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it\nwas only set to `true` if the call came from a direct `STATICCALL` opcode.\n\nHowever, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. The issue\nonly impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`.\n\nFor those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state transitions.",
