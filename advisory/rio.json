The drop code\nis responsible for waiting until the kernel completes the I/O operation into, or\nout of, the buffer borrowed by `rio::Completion`. Leaking the struct will allow\none to access and/or drop the buffer, which can lead to a use-after-free,\ndata races or leaking secrets.\n\nUpstream is not interested in fixing the issue.",
