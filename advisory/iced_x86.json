      "description": "Versions of iced-x86 <= 1.10.3 invoke undefined behavior which may cause soundness\nissues in crates using the `iced_x86::Decoder` struct. The `Decoder::new()` function\nmade a call to `slice.get_unchecked(slice.length())` to get the end position of \nthe input buffer. The flaw was fixed with safe logic that does not invoke undefined\nbehavior.\n\nMore details can be found at <https://github.com/icedland/iced/issues/168>.",
