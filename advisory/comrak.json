      "description": "[comrak](https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak) operates by default in a \"safe\"\nmode of operation where unsafe content, such as arbitrary raw HTML or URLs with\nnon-standard schemes, are not permitted in the output.  This is per the\nreference GFM implementation, [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark).\n\nAmpersands were not being correctly escaped in link targets, making it possible\nto fashion unsafe URLs using schemes like `data:` or `javascript:` by entering\nthem as HTML entities, e.g. `&#x64&#x61&#x74&#x61&#x3a`.  The intended\nbehaviour, demonstrated upstream, is that these should be escaped and therefore\nharmless, but this behaviour was broken in comrak.",
