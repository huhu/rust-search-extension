## From *u/daniel5151*

> This is one of those extensions I've had installed for so long that I often forget that it's not built right into Chrome! Thanks again for the regular updates, and keep up the good work :)

## From *u/zim0369*

> Didn't know about this and I also didn't know that I needed this so bad. Tysm

## From *u/Nilstrieb*

> The only time I even notice that I have it installed is whenever I'm in a browser that doesn't. It's such a great extension that I use all the time!

## From *@Kazuhiro Serizawa*

> 同僚氏に教えてもらったRustのdocやcrateをchromeのURL barでincremental searchできるようになるchrome extension．超便利．

## From *@Lucretiel*

> If you aren't using the Rust Search extension, you absolutely should be. 
> Makes it several times faster to land where you want, \*especially\* with some 
> libraries (cough nom cough) for which Google stubbornly prefers to link to old version.

## From *u/Michael-F-Bryan*

> I love this extension! It's super useful when I'm doing a code reviews or answering newbie questions and need to quickly link to API docs or crates.io.

## From *u/sonaxaton*

> Congrats! Love this extension, lots of useful features.

## From *u/iulian_r*

> This is by far the best extension I know about for a programming language I use.
> You also seem to have great ideas for new features, which you keep adding on a fast pace. 
> All of them are also features that I did not even know that I want.

## From *u/ErichDonGubler*

> I love this extension. It works so well, and it's fundamental for me when 
> I'm working in codebases with deps I don't know like the back of my hand. 
> It's crazy to me that it can even compete with a `cargo doc --open` invocation 
> now that one can cache crate docs locally.
 
## From *u/gnosnivek*

> This extension was probably the only thing keeping me sane when I was working on a homebrew gzip implementation for a crazy idea of mine. Tracking bitstreams and bitvectors and bit(?????)s was a mess, and google searches were pulling up weird outdated docs for the crates I was using.

> Thanks for all your work on the extension, and congrats on 1.0!

## From *u/iulian_r*

> Hey, amazing extension, I use it daily. Keep up the good work!

## From *u/zivkovicmilan*

> It is really useful, especially for me who is new to rust :)

## From *u/AReallyTallHorse*

> This is amazing, I'll have to pass this over to my friends!
> Something that really bothers me about searching for Rust docs is I always 
> end up on a page that says there is a newer version, 
> but when I click on that newer version I lose the page I was on
> (or there might not be a link at all!) This makes life so much better, thank you!

## From *u/zbraniecki*

> Thanks for your efforts! The extension is handy indeed despite all the other ways 
> to search docs (like DDG bangs, FF custom search engines, offline docs like Zeal or devdocs.io).

## From *Paul-Sebastian Manole*

> Keep on improving it and adding new features! This extension is awesome!

## From *arthamys*

> This new version greatly improves productivity, and adds a lot of shorthands to 
> make navigating the docs even more efficient
